Standing on a corner of the Avenue no longer fashionable for<br><br>residence, it looked upon the swelling tide of business with an<br><br>expression of complacency and half-disdain.<br><br><br><br>The house was not beautiful.  There was nothing in its straight front<br><br>of chocolate-colored stone, its heavy cornices, its broad, staring<br><br>windows of plate glass, its carved and bronze-bedecked mahogany doors<br><br>at the top of the wide stoop, to charm the eye or fascinate the<br><br>imagination.  But it was eminently respectable, and in its way<br><br>imposing.  It seemed to say that the glittering shops of the jewelers,<br><br>the milliners, the confectioners, the florists, the picture-dealers,<br><br>the furriers, the makers of rare and costly antiquities, retail traders<br><br>in luxuries of life, were beneath the notice of a house that had its<br><br>foundations in the high finance, and was built literally and<br><br>figuratively in the shadow of St. Petronius' Church.<br><br><br><br>At the same time there was something self-pleased and congratulatory in<br><br>the way in which the mansion held its own amid the changing<br><br>neighborhood.  It almost seemed to be lifted up a little, among the<br><br>tall buildings near at hand, as if it felt the rising value of the land<br><br>on which it stood.<br><br><br><br>John Weightman was like the house into which he had built himself<br><br>thirty years ago, and in which his ideals and ambitions were incrusted.<br><br>He was a self-made man.  But in making himself he had chosen a highly<br><br>esteemed pattern and worked according to the approved rules.  There was<br><br>nothing irregular, questionable, flamboyant about him.<br><br><br><br>He was solid, correct, and justly successful.<br><br><br><br>His minor tastes, of course, had been carefully kept up to date.<br><br><br><br>At the proper time, pictures of the Barbizon masters, old English plate<br><br>and portraits, bronzes by Barye and marbles by Rodin, Persian carpets<br><br>and Chinese porcelains, had been introduced to the mansion.  It<br><br>contained a Louis Quinze reception-room, an Empire drawing-room, a<br><br>Jacobean dining-room, and various apartments dimly reminiscent of the<br><br>styles of furniture affected by deceased monarchs.  That the hallways<br><br>were too short for the historic perspective did not make much<br><br>difference.  American decorative art is capable de tout, it absorbs all<br><br>periods.  Of each period Mr. Weightman wished to have something of the<br><br>best.  He understood its value, present as a certificate, and<br><br>prospective as an investment.<br><br><br><br>It was only in the architecture of his town house that he remained<br><br>conservative, immovable, one might almost say<br><br>Early-Victorian-Christian.  His country house at Dulwich-on-the-Sound<br><br>was a palace of the Italian Renaissance.  But in town he adhered to an<br><br>architecture which had moral associations, the<br><br>Nineteenth-Century-Brownstone epoch.  It was a symbol of his social<br><br>position, his religious doctrine, and even, in a way, of his business<br><br>creed.<br><br><br><br>"A man of fixed principles," he would say, "should express them in the<br><br>looks of his house.  New York changes its domestic architecture too<br><br>rapidly.  It is like divorce.  It is not dignified.  I don't like it.<br><br>Extravagance and fickleness are advertised in most of these new houses.<br><br>I wish to be known for different qualities.  Dignity and prudence are<br><br>the things that people trust.  Every one knows that I can afford to<br><br>live in the house that suits me.  It is a guarantee to the public.  It<br><br>inspires confidence.  It helps my influence.  There is a text in the<br><br>Bible about 'a house that hath foundations.' That is the proper kind of<br><br>a mansion for a solid man."<br><br><br><br>Harold Weightman had often listened to his father discoursing in this<br><br>fashion on the fundamental principles of life, and always with a<br><br>divided mind.  He admired immensely his father's talents and the<br><br>single-minded energy with which he improved them.  But in the paternal<br><br>philosophy there was something that disquieted and oppressed the young<br><br>man, and made him gasp inwardly for fresh air and free action.<br><br><br><br>At times, during his college course and his years at the law school, he<br><br>had yielded to this impulse and broken away--now toward extravagance<br><br>and dissipation, and then, when the reaction came, toward a romantic<br><br>devotion to work among the poor.  He had felt his father's disapproval<br><br>for both of these forms of imprudence; but is was never expressed in a<br><br>harsh or violent way, always with a certain tolerant patience, such as<br><br>one might show for the mistakes and vagaries of the very young.  John<br><br>Weightman was not hasty, impulsive, inconsiderate, even toward his own<br><br>children.  With them, as with the rest of the world, he felt that he<br><br>had a reputation to maintain, a theory to vindicate.  He could afford<br><br>to give them time to see that he was absolutely right.<br><br><br><br>One of his favorite Scripture quotations was, "Wait on the Lord."<br><br><br><br>He had applied it to real estate and to people, with profitable results.<br><br><br><br>But to human persons the sensation of being waited for is not always<br><br>agreeable.  Sometimes, especially with the young, it produces a vague<br><br>restlessness, a dumb resentment, which is increased by the fact that<br><br>one can hardly explain or justify it.  Of this John Weightman was not<br><br>conscious.  It lay beyond his horizon.  He did not take it into account<br><br>in the plan of life which he made for himself and for his family as the<br><br>sharers and inheritors of his success.<br><br><br><br>"Father plays us," said Harold, in a moment of irritation, to his<br><br>mother, "like pieces in a game of chess.<br><br><br><br>"My dear," said that lady, whose faith in her husband was religious,<br><br>"you ought not to speak so impatiently.  At least he wins the game.  He<br><br>is one of the most respected men in New York.  And he is very generous,<br><br>too."<br><br><br><br>"I wish he would be more generous in letting us be ourselves," said the<br><br>young man.  "He always has something in view for us and expects to move<br><br>us up to it."<br><br><br><br>"But isn't it always for our benefit?" replied his mother.  "Look what<br><br>a position we have.  No one can say there is any taint on our money.<br><br>There are no rumors about your father.  He has kept the laws of God and<br><br>of man.  He has never made any mistakes." Harold got up from his chair<br><br>and poked the fire.  Then he came back to the ample, well-gowned,<br><br>firm-looking lady, and sat beside her on the sofa.  He took her hand<br><br>gently and looked at the two rings--a thin band of yellow gold, and a<br><br>small solitaire diamond--which kept their place on her third finger in<br><br>modest dignity, as if not shamed, but rather justified, by the splendor<br><br>of the emerald which glittered beside them.<br><br><br><br>"Mother," he said, "you have a wonderful hand.  And father made no<br><br>mistake when he won you.  But are you sure he has always been so<br><br>inerrant?"<br><br><br><br>"Harold," she exclaimed, a little stiffly, "what do you mean?  His life<br><br>is an open book."<br><br><br><br>"Oh," he answered, "I don't mean anything bad, mother dear.  I know the<br><br>governor's life is an open book--a ledger, if you like, kept in the<br><br>best bookkeeping hand, and always ready for inspection--every page<br><br>correct, and showing a handsome balance.  But isn't it a mistake not to<br><br>allow us to make our own mistakes, to learn for ourselves, to live our<br><br>own lives?  Must we be always working for 'the balance,' in one thing<br><br>or another?  I want to be myself--to get outside of this everlasting,<br><br>profitable 'plan'--to let myself go, and lose myself for a while at<br><br>least--to do the things that I want to do, just because I want to do<br><br>them."<br><br><br><br>"My boy," said his mother, anxiously, "you are not going to do anything<br><br>wrong or foolish?  You know the falsehood of that old proverb about<br><br>wild oats."<br><br><br><br>He threw back his head and laughed.  "Yes, mother," he answered, "I<br><br>know it well enough.  But in California, you know, the wild oats are<br><br>one of the most valuable crops.  They grow all over the hillsides and<br><br>keep the cattle and the horses alive.  But that wasn't what I meant--to<br><br>sow wild oats.  Say to pick wild flowers, if you like, or even to chase<br><br>wild geese--to do something that seems good to me just for its own<br><br>sake, not for the sake of wages of one kind or another.  I feel like a<br><br>hired man, in the service of this magnificent mansion--say in training<br><br>for father's place as majordomo.  I'd like to get out some way, to feel<br><br>free--perhaps to do something for others."<br><br><br><br>The young man's voice hesitated a little.  "Yes, it sounds like cant, I<br><br>know, but sometimes I feel as if I'd like to do some good in the world,<br><br>if father only wouldn't insist upon God's putting it into the ledger."<br><br><br><br>His mother moved uneasily, and a slight look of bewilderment came into<br><br>her face.<br><br><br><br>"Isn't that almost irreverent?" she asked.  "Surely the righteous must<br><br>have their reward.  And your father is good.  See how much he gives to<br><br>all the established charities, how many things he has founded.  He's<br><br>always thinking of others, and planning for them.  And surely, for us,<br><br>he does everything.  How well he has planned this trip to Europe for me<br><br>and the girls--the court-presentation at Berlin, the season on the<br><br>Riviera, the visits in England with the Plumptons and the Halverstones.<br><br>He says Lord Halverstone has the finest old house in Sussex, pure<br><br>Elizabethan, and all the old customs are kept up, too--family prayers<br><br>every morning for all the domestics.  By-the-way, you know his son<br><br>Bertie, I believe."<br><br><br><br>Harold smiled a little to himself as he answered: "Yes, I fished at<br><br>Catalina Island last June with the Honorable Ethelbert; he's rather a<br><br>decent chap, in spite of his ingrowing mind.  But you?--mother, you are<br><br>simply magnificent!  You are father's masterpiece."  The young man<br><br>leaned over to kiss her, and went up to the Riding Club for his<br><br>afternoon canter in the Park.<br><br><br><br>So it came to pass, early in December, that Mrs. Weightman and her two<br><br>daughters sailed for Europe, on their serious pleasure trip, even as it<br><br>had been written in the book of Providence; and John Weightman, who had<br><br>made the entry, was left to pass the rest of the winter with his son<br><br>and heir in the brownstone mansion.<br><br><br><br>They were comfortable enough.  The machinery of the massive<br><br>establishment ran as smoothly as a great electric dynamo.  They were<br><br>busy enough, too.  John Weightman's plans and enterprises were<br><br>complicated, though his principle of action was always simple--to get<br><br>good value for every expenditure and effort.  The banking-house of<br><br>which he was the chief, the brain, the will, the absolutely controlling<br><br>hand, was so admirably organized that the details of its direction took<br><br>but little time.<br><br><br><br>But the scores of other interests that radiated from it and were<br><br>dependent upon it--or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, that<br><br>contributed to its solidity and success--the many investments,<br><br>industrial, political, benevolent, reformatory, ecclesiastical, that<br><br>had made the name of Weightman well known and potent in city, church,<br><br>and state, demanded much attention and careful steering, in order that<br><br>each might produce the desired result.  There were board meetings of<br><br>corporations and hospitals, conferences in Wall Street and at Albany,<br><br>consultations and committee meetings in the brownstone mansion.<br><br><br><br>For a share in all this business and its adjuncts John Weightman had<br><br>his son in training in one of the famous law firms of the city; for he<br><br>held that banking itself is a simple affair, the only real difficulties<br><br>of finance are on its legal side.  Meantime he wished the young man to<br><br>meet and know the men with whom he would have to deal when he became a<br><br>partner in the house.  So a couple of dinners were given in the mansion<br><br>during December, after which the father called the son's attention to<br><br>the fact that over a hundred million dollars had sat around the board.<br><br><br><br>But on Christmas Eve father and son were dining together without<br><br>guests, and their talk across the broad table, glittering with silver<br><br>and cut glass, and softly lit by shaded candles, was intimate, though a<br><br>little slow at times.  The elder man was in rather a rare mood, more<br><br>expansive and confidential than usual; and, when the coffee was brought<br><br>in and they were left alone, he talked more freely of his personal<br><br>plans and hopes than he had ever done before.<br><br><br><br>"I feel very grateful to-night," said he, at last; "it must be<br><br>something in the air of Christmas that gives me this feeling of<br><br>thankfulness for the many divine mercies that have been bestowed upon<br><br>me.  All the principles by which I have tried to guide my life have<br><br>been justified.  I have never made the value of this salted almond by<br><br>anything that the courts would not uphold, at least in the long run,<br><br>and yet--or wouldn't it be truer to say and therefore?--my affairs have<br><br>been wonderfully prospered.  There's a great deal in that text 'Honesty<br><br>is the best'--but no, that's not from the Bible, after all, is it?<br><br>Wait a moment; there is something of that kind, I know."<br><br><br><br>"May I light a cigar, father," said Harold, turning away to hide a<br><br>smile, "while you are remembering the text?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes, certainly," answered the elder man, rather shortly; "you know I<br><br>don't dislike the smell.  But it is a wasteful, useless habit, and<br><br>therefore I have never practised it.  Nothing useless is worth while,<br><br>that's my motto--nothing that does not bring the reward.  Oh, now I<br><br>recall the text, 'Verily I say unto you they have their reward.' I<br><br>shall ask Doctor Snodgrass to preach a sermon on that verse some day."<br><br><br><br>"Using you as an illustration?"<br><br><br><br>"Well, not exactly that; but I could give him some good materials from<br><br>my own experience to prove the truth of Scripture.  I can honestly say<br><br>that there is not one of my charities that has not brought me in a good<br><br>return, either in the increase of influence, the building up of credit,<br><br>or the association with substantial people.  Of course you have to be<br><br>careful how you give, in order to secure the best results--no<br><br>indiscriminate giving--no pennies in beggars' hats!  It has been one of<br><br>my principles always to use the same kind of judgment in charities that<br><br>I use in my other affairs, and they have not disappointed me."<br><br><br><br>"Even the check that you put in the plate when you take the offertory<br><br>up the aisle on Sunday morning?"<br><br><br><br>"Certainly; though there the influence is less direct; and I must<br><br>confess that I have my doubts in regard to the collection for Foreign<br><br>Missions.  That always seems to me romantic and wasteful.  You never<br><br>hear from it in any definite way.  They say the missionaries have done<br><br>a good deal to open the way for trade; perhaps--but they have also<br><br>gotten us into commercial and political difficulties.  Yet I give to<br><br>them--a little--it is a matter of conscience with me to identify myself<br><br>with all the enterprises of the Church; it is the mainstay of social<br><br>order and a prosperous civilization.  But the best forms of benevolence<br><br>are the well-established, organized ones here at home, where people can<br><br>see them and know what they are doing."<br><br><br><br>"You mean the ones that have a local habitation and a name."<br><br><br><br>"Yes; they offer by far the safest return, though of course there is<br><br>something gained by contributing to general funds.  A public man can't<br><br>afford to be without public spirit.  But on the whole I prefer a<br><br>building, or an endowment.  There is a mutual advantage to a good name<br><br>and a good institution in their connection in the public mind.  It<br><br>helps them both.  Remember that, my boy.  Of course at the beginning<br><br>you will have to practise it in a small way; later, you will have<br><br>larger opportunities.  But try to put your gifts where they can be<br><br>identified and do good all around.  You'll see the wisdom of it in the<br><br>long run."<br><br><br><br>"I can see it already, sir, and the way you describe it looks amazingly<br><br>wise and prudent.  In other words, we must cast our bread on the waters<br><br>in large loaves, carried by sound ships marked with the owner's name,<br><br>so that the return freight will be sure to come back to us."<br><br><br><br>The father laughed, but his eyes were frowning a little as if he<br><br>suspected something irreverent under the respectful reply.  "You put it<br><br>humorously, but there's sense in what you say.  Why not?  God rules the<br><br>sea; but He expects us to follow the laws of navigation and commerce.<br><br>Why not take good care of your bread, even when you give it away?"<br><br><br><br>"It's not for me to say why not--and yet I can think of cases--"<br><br><br><br>The young man hesitated for a moment.  His half-finished cigar had gone<br><br>out.  He rose and tossed it into the fire, in front of which he<br><br>remained standing--a slender, eager, restless young figure, with a<br><br>touch of hunger in the fine face, strangely like and unlike the father,<br><br>at whom he looked with half-wistful curiosity.<br><br><br><br>"The fact is, sir," he continued, "there is such a case in my mind now,<br><br>and it is a good deal on my heart, too.  So I thought of speaking to<br><br>you about it to-night.  You remember Tom Rollins, the Junior who was so<br><br>good to me when I entered college?"<br><br><br><br>The father nodded.  He remembered very well indeed the annoying<br><br>incidents of his son's first escapade, and how Rollins had stood by him<br><br>and helped to avoid a public disgrace, and how a close friendship had<br><br>grown between the two boys, so different in their fortunes.<br><br><br><br>"Yes," he said, "I remember him.  He was a promising young man.  Has he<br><br>succeeded?"<br><br><br><br>"Not exactly--that is not yet.  His business has been going rather<br><br>badly.  He has a wife and little baby, you know.  And now he has broken<br><br>down,--something wrong with his lungs.  The doctor says his only chance<br><br>is a year or eighteen months in Colorado.  I wish we could help him."<br><br><br><br>"How much would it cost?"<br><br><br><br>"Three or four thousand, perhaps, as a loan."<br><br><br><br>"Does the doctor say he will get well?"<br><br><br><br>"A fighting chance--the doctor says."<br><br><br><br>The face of the older man changed subtly.  Not a line was altered, but<br><br>it seemed to have a different substance, as if it were carved out of<br><br>some firm, imperishable stuff.<br><br><br><br>"A fighting chance," he said, "may do for a speculation, but it is not<br><br>a good investment.  You owe something to young Rollins.  Your grateful<br><br>feeling does you credit.  But don't overwork it.  Send him three or<br><br>four hundred, if you like.  You'll never hear from it again, except in<br><br>the letter of thanks.  But for Heaven's sake don't be sentimental.<br><br>Religion is not a matter of sentiment; it's a matter of principle."<br><br><br><br>The face of the younger man changed now.  But instead of becoming fixed<br><br>and graven, it seemed to melt into life by the heat of an inward fire.<br><br>His nostrils quivered with quick breath, his lips were curled.<br><br>"Principle!" he said.  "You mean principal--and interest too.  Well,<br><br>sir, you know best whether that is religion or not.  But if it is,<br><br>count me out, please.  Tom saved me from going to the devil, six years<br><br>ago; and I'll be damned if I don't help him to the best of my ability<br><br>now."<br><br><br><br>John Weightman looked at his son steadily.  "Harold," he said at last,<br><br>"you know I dislike violent language, and it never has any influence<br><br>with me.  If I could honestly approve of this proposition of yours, I'd<br><br>let you have the money; but I can't; it's extravagant and useless.  But<br><br>you have your Christmas check for a thousand dollars coming to you<br><br>to-morrow.  You can use it as you please.  I never interfere with your<br><br>private affairs."<br><br><br><br>"Thank you," said Harold.  "Thank you very much!  But there's another<br><br>private affair.  I want to get away from this life, this town, this<br><br>house.  It stifles me.  You refused last summer when I asked you to let<br><br>me go up to Grenfell's Mission on the Labrador.  I could go now, at<br><br>least as far as the Newfoundland Station.  Have you changed your mind?"<br><br><br><br>"Not at all.  I think it is an exceedingly foolish enterprise.  It<br><br>would interrupt the career that I have marked out for you."<br><br><br><br>"Well, then, here's a cheaper proposition.  Algy Vanderhoof wants me to<br><br>join him on his yacht with--well, with a little party--to cruise in the<br><br>West Indies.  Would you prefer that?"<br><br><br><br>"Certainly not!  The Vanderhoof set is wild and godless--I do not wish<br><br>to see you keeping company with fools who walk in the broad and easy<br><br>way that leads to perdition."<br><br><br><br>"It is rather a hard choice," said the young man, with a short laugh,<br><br>turning toward the door.  "According to you there's very little<br><br>difference--a fool's paradise or a fool's hell!  Well, it's one or the<br><br>other for me, and I'll toss up for it to-night: heads, I lose; tails,<br><br>the devil wins.  Anyway, I'm sick of this, and I'm out of it."<br><br><br><br>"Harold," said the older man (and there was a slight tremor in his<br><br>voice), "don't let us quarrel on Christmas Eve.  All I want is to<br><br>persuade you to think seriously of the duties and responsibilities to<br><br>which God has called you--don't speak lightly of heaven and<br><br>hell--remember, there is another life."<br><br><br><br>The young man came back and laid his hand upon his father's shoulder.<br><br><br><br>"Father," he said, "I want to remember it.  I try to believe in it.<br><br>But somehow or other, in this house, it all seems unreal to me.  No<br><br>doubt all you say is perfectly right and wise.  I don't venture to<br><br>argue against it, but I can't feel it--that's all.  If I'm to have a<br><br>soul, either to lose or to save, I must really live.  Just now neither<br><br>the present nor the future means anything to me.  But surely we won't<br><br>quarrel.  I'm very grateful to you, and we'll part friends.<br><br>Good-night, sir."<br><br><br><br>The father held out his hand in silence.  The heavy portiere dropped<br><br>noiselessly behind the son, and he went up the wide, curving stairway<br><br>to his own room.<br><br><br><br>Meantime John Weightman sat in his carved chair in the Jacobean<br><br>dining-room.  He felt strangely old and dull.  The portraits of<br><br>beautiful women by Lawrence and Reynolds and Raeburn, which had often<br><br>seemed like real company to him, looked remote and uninteresting.<br><br><br><br>He fancied something cold and almost unfriendly in their expression, as<br><br>if they were staring through him or beyond him.  They cared nothing for<br><br>his principles, his hopes, his disappointments, his successes; they<br><br>belonged to another world, in which he had no place.  At this he felt a<br><br>vague resentment, a sense of discomfort that he could not have defined<br><br>or explained.  He was used to being considered, respected, appreciated<br><br>at his full value in every region, even in that of his own dreams.<br><br><br><br>Presently he rang for the butler, telling him to close the house and<br><br>not to sit up, and walked with lagging steps into the long library,<br><br>where the shaded lamps were burning.  His eye fell upon the low shelves<br><br>full of costly books, but he had no desire to open them.  Even the<br><br>carefully chosen pictures that hung above them seemed to have lost<br><br>their attraction.  He paused for a moment before an idyll of Corot--a<br><br>dance of nymphs around some forgotten altar in a vaporous glade--and<br><br>looked at it curiously.  There was something rapturous and serene about<br><br>the picture, a breath of spring-time in the misty trees, a harmony of<br><br>joy in the dancing figures, that wakened in him a feeling of<br><br>half-pleasure and half-envy.  It represented something that he had<br><br>never known in his calculated, orderly life.  He was dimly mistrustful<br><br>of it.<br><br><br><br>"It is certainly very beautiful," he thought, "but it is distinctly<br><br>pagan; that altar is built to some heathen god.  It does not fit into<br><br>the scheme of a Christian life.  I doubt whether it is consistent with<br><br>the tone of my house.  I will sell it this winter.  It will bring three<br><br>or four times what I paid for it.  That was a good purchase, a very<br><br>good bargain."<br><br><br><br>He dropped into the revolving chair before his big library table.<br><br><br><br>It was covered with pamphlets and reports of the various enterprises in<br><br>which he was interested.  There was a pile of newspaper clippings in<br><br>which his name was mentioned with praise for his sustaining power as a<br><br>pillar of finance, for his judicious benevolence, for his support of<br><br>wise and prudent reform movements, for his discretion in making<br><br>permanent public gifts--"the Weightman Charities," one very complaisant<br><br>editor called them, as if they deserved classification as a distinct<br><br>species.  He turned the papers over listlessly.  There was a description<br><br>and a picture of the "Weightman Wing of the Hospital for Cripples," of<br><br>which he was president; and an article on the new professor in the<br><br>"Weightman Chair of Political Jurisprudence" in Jackson University, of<br><br>which he was a trustee; and an illustrated account of the opening of<br><br>the "Weightman Grammar-School" at Dulwich-on-the-Sound, where he had<br><br>his legal residence for purposes of taxation.<br><br><br><br>This last was perhaps the most carefully planned of all the Weightman<br><br>Charities.  He desired to win the confidence and support of his rural<br><br>neighbors.  It had pleased him much when the local newspaper had spoken<br><br>of him as an ideal citizen and the logical candidate for the<br><br>Governorship of the State; but upon the whole it seemed to him wiser to<br><br>keep out of active politics.  It would be easier and better to put<br><br>Harold into the running, to have him sent to the Legislature from the<br><br>Dulwich district, then to the national House, then to the Senate.  Why<br><br>not?  The Weightman interests were large enough to need a direct<br><br>representative and guardian at Washington.<br><br><br><br>But to-night all these plans came back to him with dust upon them.<br><br>They were dry and crumbling like forsaken habitations.  The son upon<br><br>whom his complacent ambition had rested had turned his back upon the<br><br>mansion of his father's hopes.  The break might not be final; and in<br><br>any event there would be much to live for; the fortunes of the family<br><br>would be secure.  But the zest of it all would be gone if John<br><br>Weightman had to give up the assurance of perpetuating his name and his<br><br>principles in his son.  It was a bitter disappointment, and he felt<br><br>that he had not deserved it.<br><br><br><br>He rose from the chair and paced the room with leaden feet.  For the<br><br>first time in his life his age was visibly upon him.  His head was<br><br>heavy and hot, and the thoughts that rolled in it were confused and<br><br>depressing.  Could it be that he had made a mistake in the principles<br><br>of his existence?  There was no argument in what Harold had said--it<br><br>was almost childish--and yet it had shaken the elder man more deeply<br><br>than he cared to show.  It held a silent attack which touched him more<br><br>than open criticism.<br><br><br><br>Suppose the end of his life were nearer than he thought--the end must<br><br>come some time--what if it were now?  Had he not founded his house upon<br><br>a rock?  Had he not kept the Commandments?  Was he not, "touching the<br><br>law, blameless"?  And beyond this, even if there were some faults in<br><br>his character--and all men are sinners--yet he surely believed in the<br><br>saving doctrines of religion--the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection<br><br>of the body, the life everlasting.  Yes, that was the true source of<br><br>comfort, after all.  He would read a bit in the Bible, as he did every<br><br>night, and go to bed and to sleep.<br><br><br><br>He went back to his chair at the library table.  A strange weight of<br><br>weariness rested upon him, but he opened the book at a familiar place,<br><br>and his eyes fell upon the verse at the bottom of the page.<br><br><br><br>"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth."<br><br><br><br>That had been the text of the sermon a few weeks before.  Sleepily,<br><br>heavily, he tried to fix his mind upon it and recall it.  What was it<br><br>that Doctor Snodgrass had said?  Ah, yes--that it was a mistake to<br><br>pause here in reading the verse.  We must read on without a pause--Lay<br><br>not up treasures upon earth where moth and rust do corrupt and where<br><br>thieves break through and steal--that was the true doctrine.  We may<br><br>have treasures upon earth, but they must not be put into unsafe places,<br><br>but into safe places.  A most comforting doctrine!  He had always<br><br>followed it.  Moths and rust and thieves had done no harm to his<br><br>investments.<br><br><br><br>John Weightman's drooping eyes turned to the next verse, at the top of<br><br>the second column.<br><br><br><br>"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."<br><br><br><br>Now what had the Doctor said about that?  How was it to be<br><br>understood--in what sense--treasures--in heaven?<br><br><br><br>The book seemed to float away from him.  The light vanished.  He<br><br>wondered dimly if this could be Death, coming so suddenly, so quietly,<br><br>so irresistibly.  He struggled for a moment to hold himself up, and<br><br>then sank slowly forward upon the table.  His head rested upon his<br><br>folded hands.  He slipped into the unknown.<br><br><br><br>How long afterward conscious life returned to him he did not know.  The<br><br>blank might have been an hour or a century.  He knew only that<br><br>something had happened in the interval.  What is was he could not tell.<br><br>He found great difficulty in catching the thread of his identity again.<br><br>He felt that he was himself; but the trouble was to make his<br><br>connections, to verify and place himself, to know who and where he was.<br><br><br><br>At last it grew clear.  John Weightman was sitting on a stone, not far<br><br>from a road in a strange land.<br><br><br><br>The road was not a formal highway, fenced and graded.  It was more like<br><br>a great travel-trace, worn by thousands of feet passing across the open<br><br>country in the same direction.  Down in the valley, into which he could<br><br>look, the road seemed to form itself gradually out of many minor paths;<br><br>little footways coming across the meadows, winding tracks following<br><br>along beside the streams, faintly marked trails emerging from the<br><br>woodlands.  But on the hillside the threads were more firmly woven into<br><br>one clear band of travel, though there were still a few dim paths<br><br>joining it here and there, as if persons had been climbing up the hill<br><br>by other ways and had turned at last to seek the road.<br><br><br><br>From the edge of the hill, where John Weightman sat, he could see the<br><br>travelers, in little groups or larger companies, gathering from time to<br><br>time by the different paths, and making the ascent.  They were all<br><br>clothed in white, and the form of their garments was strange to him; it<br><br>was like some old picture.  They passed him, group after group, talking<br><br>quietly together or singing; not moving in haste, but with a certain<br><br>air of eagerness and joy as if they were glad to be on their way to an<br><br>appointed place.  They did not stay to speak to him, but they looked at<br><br>him often and spoke to one another as they looked; and now and then one<br><br>of them would smile and beckon him a friendly greeting, so that he felt<br><br>they would like him to be with them.<br><br><br><br>There was quite an interval between the groups; and he followed each of<br><br>them with his eyes after it had passed, blanching the long ribbon of<br><br>the road for a little transient space, rising and receding across the<br><br>wide, billowy upland, among the rounded hillocks of aerial green and<br><br>gold and lilac, until it came to the high horizon, and stood outlined<br><br>for a moment, a tiny cloud of whiteness against the tender blue, before<br><br>it vanished over the hill.<br><br><br><br>For a long time he sat there watching and wondering.  It was a very<br><br>different world from that in which his mansion on the Avenue was built;<br><br>and it looked strange to him, but most real--as real as anything he had<br><br>ever seen.  Presently he felt a strong desire to know what country it<br><br>was and where the people were going.  He had a faint premonition of<br><br>what it must be, but he wished to be sure.  So he rose from the stone<br><br>where he was sitting, and came down through the short grass and the<br><br>lavender flowers, toward a passing group of people.  One of them turned<br><br>to meet him, and held out his hand.  It was an old man, under whose<br><br>white beard and brows John Weightman thought he saw a suggestion of the<br><br>face of the village doctor who had cared for him years ago, when he was<br><br>a boy in the country.<br><br><br><br>"Welcome," said the old man.  "Will you come with us?"<br><br><br><br>"Where are you going?"<br><br><br><br>"To the heavenly city, to see our mansions there."<br><br><br><br>"And who are these with you?"<br><br><br><br>"Strangers to me, until a little while ago; I know them better now.<br><br>But you I have known for a long time, John Weightman.  Don't you<br><br>remember your old doctor?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes," he cried--"yes; your voice has not changed at all.  I'm glad<br><br>indeed to see you, Doctor McLean, especially now.  All this seems very<br><br>strange to me, almost oppressive.  I wonder if--but may I go with you,<br><br>do you suppose?"<br><br><br><br>"Surely," answered the doctor, with his familiar smile; "it will do you<br><br>good.  And you also must have a mansion in the city waiting for you--a<br><br>fine one, too--are you not looking forward to it?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes," replied the other, hesitating a moment; "yes--I believe it must<br><br>be so, although I had not expected to see it so soon.  But I will go<br><br>with you, and we can talk by the way."<br><br><br><br>The two men quickly caught up with the other people, and all went<br><br>forward together along the road.  The doctor had little to tell of his<br><br>experience, for it had been a plain, hard life, uneventfully spent for<br><br>others, and the story of the village was very simple.  John Weightman's<br><br>adventures and triumphs would have made a far richer, more imposing<br><br>history, full of contacts with the great events and personages of the<br><br>time.  But somehow or other he did not care to speak much about it,<br><br>walking on that wide heavenly moorland, under that tranquil, sunless<br><br>arch of blue, in that free air of perfect peace, where the light was<br><br>diffused without a shadow, as if the spirit of life in all things were<br><br>luminous.<br><br><br><br>There was only one person besides the doctor in that little company<br><br>whom John Weightman had known before--an old bookkeeper who had spent<br><br>his life over a desk, carefully keeping accounts--a rusty, dull little<br><br>man, patient and narrow, whose wife had been in the insane asylum for<br><br>twenty years and whose only child was a crippled daughter, for whose<br><br>comfort and happiness he had toiled and sacrificed himself without<br><br>stint.  It was a surprise to find him here, as care-free and joyful as<br><br>the rest.<br><br><br><br>The lives of others in the company were revealed in brief glimpses as<br><br>they talked together--a mother, early widowed, who had kept her little<br><br>flock of children together and labored through hard and heavy years to<br><br>bring them up in purity and knowledge--a Sister of Charity who had<br><br>devoted herself to the nursing of poor folk who were being eaten to<br><br>death by cancer--a schoolmaster whose heart and life had been poured<br><br>into his quiet work of training boys for a clean and thoughtful<br><br>manhood--a medical missionary who had given up a brilliant career in<br><br>science to take the charge of a hospital in darkest Africa--a beautiful<br><br>woman with silver hair who had resigned her dreams of love and marriage<br><br>to care for an invalid father, and after his death had made her life a<br><br>long, steady search for ways of doing kindnesses to others--a poet who<br><br>had walked among the crowded tenements of the great city, bringing<br><br>cheer and comfort not only by his songs, but by his wise and patient<br><br>works of practical aid--a paralyzed woman who had lain for thirty years<br><br>upon her bed, helpless but not hopeless, succeeding by a miracle of<br><br>courage in her single aim, never to complain, but always to impart a<br><br>bit of joy and peace to every one who came near her.  All these, and<br><br>other persons like them, people of little consideration in the world,<br><br>but now seemingly all full of great contentment and an inward gladness<br><br>that made their steps light, were in the company that passed along the<br><br>road, talking together of things past and things to come, and singing<br><br>now and then with clear voices from which the veil of age and sorrow<br><br>was lifted.<br><br><br><br>John Weightman joined in some of the songs--which were familiar to him<br><br>from their use in the church--at first with a touch of hesitation, and<br><br>then more confidently.  For as they went on his sense of strangeness<br><br>and fear at his new experience diminished, and his thoughts began to<br><br>take on their habitual assurance and complacency.  Were not these<br><br>people going to the Celestial City?  And was not he in his right place<br><br>among them?  He had always looked forward to this journey.  If they<br><br>were sure, each one, of finding a mansion there, could not he be far<br><br>more sure?  His life had been more fruitful than theirs.  He had been a<br><br>leader, a founder of new enterprises, a pillar of Church and State, a<br><br>prince of the House of Israel.  Ten talents had been given him, and he<br><br>had made them twenty.  His reward would be proportionate.  He was glad<br><br>that his companions were going to find fit dwellings prepared for them;<br><br>but he thought also with a certain pleasure of the surprise that some<br><br>of them would feel when they saw his appointed mansion.<br><br><br><br>So they came to the summit of the moorland and looked over into the<br><br>world beyond.  It was a vast, green plain, softly rounded like a<br><br>shallow vase, and circled with hills of amethyst.  A broad, shining<br><br>river flowed through it, and many silver threads of water were woven<br><br>across the green; and there were borders of tall trees on the banks of<br><br>the river, and orchards full of roses abloom along the little streams,<br><br>and in the midst of all stood the city, white and wonderful and radiant.<br><br><br><br>When the travelers saw it they were filled with awe and joy.  They<br><br>passed over the little streams and among the orchards quickly and<br><br>silently, as if they feared to speak lest the city should vanish.<br><br><br><br>The wall of the city was very low, a child could see over it, for it<br><br>was made only of precious stones, which are never large.  The gate of<br><br>the city was not like a gate a all, for it was not barred with iron or<br><br>wood, but only a single pearl, softly gleaming, marked the place where<br><br>the wall ended and the entrance lay open.<br><br><br><br>A person stood there whose face was bright and grave, and whose robe<br><br>was like the flower of the lily, not a woven fabric, but a living<br><br>texture.  "Come in," he said to the company of travelers; "you are at<br><br>your journey's end, and your mansions are ready for you."<br><br><br><br>John Weightman hesitated, for he was troubled by a doubt.  Suppose that<br><br>he was not really, like his companions, at his journey's end, but only<br><br>transported for a little while out of the regular course of his life<br><br>into this mysterious experience?  Suppose that, after all, he had not<br><br>really passed through the door of death, like these others, but only<br><br>through the door of dreams, and was walking in a vision, a living man<br><br>among the blessed dead.  Would it be right for him to go with them into<br><br>the heavenly city?  Would it not be a deception, a desecration, a deep<br><br>and unforgivable offense?  The strange, confusing question had no<br><br>reason in it, as he very well knew; for if he was dreaming, then it was<br><br>all a dream; but if his companions were real, then he also was with<br><br>them in reality, and if they had died then he must have died too.  Yet<br><br>he could not rid his mind of the sense that there was a difference<br><br>between them and him, and it made him afraid to go on.  But, as he<br><br>paused and turned, the Keeper of the Gate looked straight and deep into<br><br>his eyes, and beckoned to him.  Then he knew that it was not only right<br><br>but necessary that he should enter.<br><br><br><br>They passed from street to street among fair and spacious dwellings,<br><br>set in amaranthine gardens, and adorned with an infinitely varied<br><br>beauty of divine simplicity.  The mansions differed in size, in shape,<br><br>in charm: each one seemed to have its own personal look of loveliness;<br><br>yet all were alike in fitness to their place, in harmony with one<br><br>another, in the addition which each made to the singular and tranquil<br><br>splendor of the city.<br><br><br><br>As the little company came, one by one, to the mansions which were<br><br>prepared for them, and their Guide beckoned to the happy inhabitant to<br><br>enter in and take possession, there was a soft murmur of joy, half<br><br>wonder and half recognition; as if the new and immortal dwelling were<br><br>crowned with the beauty of surprise, lovelier and nobler than all the<br><br>dreams of it had been; and yet also as if it were touched with the<br><br>beauty of the familiar, the remembered, the long-loved.  One after<br><br>another the travelers were led to their own mansions, and went in<br><br>gladly; and from within, through the open doorways came sweet voices of<br><br>welcome, and low laughter, and song.<br><br><br><br>At last there was no one left with the Guide but the two old friends,<br><br>Doctor McLean and John Weightman.  They were standing in front of one<br><br>of the largest and fairest of the houses, whose garden glowed softly<br><br>with radiant flowers.  The Guide laid his hand upon the doctor's<br><br>shoulder.<br><br><br><br>"This is for you," he said.  "Go in; there is no more pain here, no<br><br>more death, nor sorrow, nor tears; for your old enemies are all<br><br>conquered.  But all the good that you have done for others, all the<br><br>help that you have given, all the comfort that you have brought, all<br><br>the strength and love that you have bestowed upon the suffering, are<br><br>here; for we have built them all into this mansion for you."<br><br><br><br>The good man's face was lighted with a still joy.  He clasped his old<br><br>friend's hand closely, and whispered: "How wonderful it is!  Go on, you<br><br>will come to your mansion next, it is not far away, and we shall see<br><br>each other again soon, very soon."<br><br><br><br>So he went through the garden, and into the music within.  The Keeper<br><br>of the Gate turned to John Weightman with level, quiet, searching eyes.<br><br>Then he asked, gravely:<br><br><br><br>"Where do you wish me to lead you now?"<br><br><br><br>"To see my own mansion," answered the man, with half-concealed<br><br>excitement.  "Is there not one here for me?  You may not let me enter<br><br>it yet, perhaps, for I must confess to you that I am only--"<br><br><br><br>"I know," said the Keeper of the Gate--"I know it all.  You are John<br><br>Weightman."<br><br><br><br>"Yes," said the man, more firmly than he had spoken at first, for it<br><br>gratified him that his name was known.  "Yes, I am John Weightman,<br><br>Senior Warden of St. Petronius' Church.  I wish very much to see my<br><br>mansion here, if only for a moment.  I believe that you have one for<br><br>me.  Will you take me to it?"<br><br><br><br>The Keeper of the Gate drew a little book from the breast of his robe<br><br>and turned over the pages.<br><br><br><br>"Certainly," he said, with a curious look at the man, "your name is<br><br>here; and you shall see your mansion if you will follow me."<br><br><br><br>It seemed as if they must have walked miles and miles, through the vast<br><br>city, passing street after street of houses larger and smaller, of<br><br>gardens richer and poorer, but all full of beauty and delight.<br><br><br><br>They came into a kind of suburb, where there were many small cottages,<br><br>with plots of flowers, very lowly, but bright and fragrant.  Finally<br><br>they reached an open field, bare and lonely-looking.  There were two or<br><br>three little bushes in it, without flowers, and the grass was sparse<br><br>and thin.  In the center of the field was a tiny hut, hardly big enough<br><br>for a shepherd's shelter.  It looked as if it had been built of<br><br>discarded things, scraps and fragments of other buildings, put together<br><br>with care and pains, by some one who had tried to make the most of<br><br>cast-off material.<br><br><br><br>There was something pitiful and shamefaced about the hut.  It shrank<br><br>and drooped and faded in its barren field, and seemed to cling only by<br><br>sufferance to the edge of the splendid city.<br><br><br><br>"This," said the Keeper of the Gate, standing still and speaking with a<br><br>low, distinct voice--"this is your mansion, John Weightman."<br><br><br><br>An almost intolerable shock of grieved wonder and indignation choked<br><br>the man for a moment so that he could not say a word.  Then he turned<br><br>his face away from the poor little hut and began to remonstrate eagerly<br><br>with his companion.<br><br><br><br>"Surely, sir," he stammered, "you must be in error about this.  There<br><br>is something wrong--some other John Weightman--a confusion of<br><br>names--the book must be mistaken."<br><br><br><br>"There is no mistake," said the Keeper of the Gate, very calmly; "here<br><br>is your name, the record of your title and your possessions in this<br><br>place."<br><br><br><br>"But how could such a house be prepared for me," cried the man, with a<br><br>resentful tremor in his voice--"for me, after my long and faithful<br><br>service?  Is this a suitable mansion for one so well known and devoted?<br><br>Why is it so pitifully small and mean?  Why have you not built it large<br><br>and fair, like the others?"<br><br><br><br>"That is all the material you sent us."<br><br><br><br>"What!"<br><br><br><br>"We have used all the material that you sent us," repeated the Keeper<br><br>of the Gate.<br><br><br><br>"Now I know that you are mistaken," cried the man, with growing<br><br>earnestness, "for all my life long I have been doing things that must<br><br>have supplied you with material.  Have you not heard that I have built<br><br>a school-house; the wing of a hospital; two--yes, three--small<br><br>churches, and the greater part of a large one, the spire of St. Petro--"<br><br><br><br>The Keeper of the Gate lifted his hand.<br><br><br><br>"Wait," he said; "we know all these things.  They were not ill done.<br><br>But they were all marked and used as foundation for the name and<br><br>mansion of John Weightman in the world.  Did you not plan them for<br><br>that?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes," answered the man, confused and taken aback, "I confess that I<br><br>thought often of them in that way.  Perhaps my heart was set upon that<br><br>too much.  But there are other things--my endowment for the college--my<br><br>steady and liberal contributions to all the established charities--my<br><br>support of every respectable--"<br><br><br><br>"Wait," said the Keeper of the Gate again.  "Were not all these<br><br>carefully recorded on earth where they would add to your credit?  They<br><br>were not foolishly done.  Verily, you have had your reward for them.<br><br>Would you be paid twice?"<br><br><br><br>"No," cried the man, with deepening dismay, "I dare not claim that.  I<br><br>acknowledge that I considered my own interest too much.  But surely not<br><br>altogether.  You have said that these things were not foolishly done.<br><br>They accomplished some good in the world.  Does not that count for<br><br>something?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes," answered he Keeper of the Gate, "it counts in the world--where<br><br>you counted it.  But it does not belong to you here.  We have saved and<br><br>used everything that you sent us.  This is the mansion prepared for<br><br>you."<br><br><br><br>As he spoke, his look grew deeper and more searching, like a flame of<br><br>fire.  John Weightman could not endure it.  It seemed to strip him<br><br>naked and wither him.  He sank to the ground under a crushing weight of<br><br>shame, covering his eyes with his hands and cowering face downward upon<br><br>the stones.  Dimly through the trouble of his mind he felt their<br><br>hardness and coldness.<br><br><br><br>"Tell me, then," he cried, brokenly, "since my life has been so little<br><br>worth, how came I here at all?"<br><br><br><br>"Through the mercy of the King"--the answer was like the soft tolling<br><br>of a bell.<br><br><br><br>"And how have I earned it?" he murmured.<br><br><br><br>"It is never earned; it is only given," came the clear, low reply.<br><br><br><br>"But how have I failed so wretchedly," he asked, "in all the purpose of<br><br>my life?  What could I have done better?  What is it that counts here?"<br><br><br><br>"Only that which is truly given," answered the bell-like voice.  "Only<br><br>that good which is done for the love of doing it.  Only those plans in<br><br>which the welfare of others is the master thought.  Only those labors<br><br>in which the sacrifice is greater than the reward.  Only those gifts in<br><br>which the giver forgets himself."<br><br><br><br>The man lay silent.  A great weakness, an unspeakable despondency and<br><br>humiliation were upon him.  But the face of the Keeper of the Gate was<br><br>infinitely tender as he bent over him.<br><br><br><br>"Think again, John Weightman.  Has there been nothing like that in your<br><br>life?"<br><br><br><br>"Nothing," he sighed.  "If there ever were such things, it must have<br><br>been long ago--they were all crowded out--I have forgotten them."<br><br><br><br>There was an ineffable smile on the face of the Keeper of the Gate, and<br><br>his hand made the sign of the cross over the bowed head as he spoke<br><br>gently:<br><br><br><br>"These are the things that the King never forgets; and because there<br><br>were a few of them in your life, you have a little place here."<br><br><br><br>The sense of coldness and hardness under John Weightman's hands grew<br><br>sharper and more distinct.  The feeling of bodily weariness and<br><br>lassitude weighed upon him, but there was a calm, almost a lightness,<br><br>in his heart as he listened to the fading vibrations of the silvery<br><br>bell-tones.  The chimney clock on the mantel had just ended the last<br><br>stroke of seven as he lifted his head from the table.  Thin, pale<br><br>strips of the city morning were falling into the room through the<br><br>narrow partings of the heavy curtains.<br><br><br><br>What was it that had happened to him?  Had he been ill?  Had he died<br><br>and come to life again?  Or had he only slept, and had his soul gone<br><br>visiting in dreams?  He sat for some time, motionless, not lost, but<br><br>finding himself in thought.  Then he took a narrow book from the table<br><br>drawer, wrote a check, and tore it out.<br><br><br><br>He went slowly up the stairs, knocked very softly at his son's door,<br><br>and, hearing no answer, entered without noise.  Harold was asleep, his<br><br>bare arm thrown above his head, and his eager face relaxed in peace.<br><br>His father looked at him a moment with strangely shining eyes, and then<br><br>tiptoed quietly to the writing-desk, found a pencil and a sheet of<br><br>paper, and wrote rapidly:<br><br><br><br>"My dear boy, here is what you asked me for; do what you like with it,<br><br>and ask for more if you need it.  If you are still thinking of that<br><br>work with Grenfell, we'll talk it over to-day after church.  I want to<br><br>know your heart better; and if I have made mistakes--"<br><br><br><br>A slight noise made him turn his head.  Harold was sitting up in bed<br><br>with wide-open eyes.<br><br><br><br>"Father!" he cried, "is that you?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes, my son," answered John Weightman; "I've come back--I mean I've<br><br>come up--no, I mean come in--well, here I am, and God give us a good<br><br>Christmas together."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Mansion, by Henry Van Dyke<br><br><br><br></body> </html>
